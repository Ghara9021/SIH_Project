<title>AI-ML Based Price Prediction for Agri-Horticultural Commodities</title>
This project focuses on developing an AI/ML-based model to predict the future prices of essential agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses, onion, and potato across different regions of the country. We collect real-time and historical price data from online sources and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast commodity prices.

To aid in price stabilization and informed decision-making, we apply Bollinger Bands on the predicted prices to identify potential price surges. When prices cross the upper band, the system flags the need to release stored crops into the market, thereby helping to mitigate inflation and ensure food security.
